# Installation:
* I had to build all mupen components - core library, and all main plugins 
* The last major release is too far behind GLideN64's latest source

# Textures:
* Texture packs often only support a specific version of a ROM.
* Zelda MM Celpack works best on European version of the game.
* .htc files are texture cache files, not true "texture packages", so you put them in the cache directories for mupen64plus
